# Twitch Chat Notifications

This is a Chrome extension that notifies you (sound/popup) when a saved phrase is mentioned in an open Twitch chat. You can then click on the notification and the computer will bring up the browser tab. The idea came from Twitch channels running giveaways where you have 2-3 minutes to join by typing a command in chat. These are easy to miss even if you spend hours watching the stream. By using this extension, you can even mute the stream and still know when to participate.

5. Load the unzipped folder through the "Load unpacked" button.
